I wanted a config that I can give to a anyone and they just have an
Emacs running with Clojure setup.

* Usage

** As your main Emacs config

If you do not have an Emacs config yet and you want to start out with
=simple-easy-emacs= :


#+begin_src shell
  cd
  git clone https://github.com/benjamin-asdf/simple-easy-emacs.git .emacs.d
#+end_src

*** windows (vista and higher)

first intall emacs. Here is a [[https://lucidmanager.org/productivity/emacs-windows/][guide]]

#+begin_src shell
  cd
  cd AppData/Roaming/
  git clone https://github.com/benjamin-asdf/simple-easy-emacs.git .emacs.d
#+end_src

run Emacs!

** Just run it without changing your real config

#+begin_src shell
  git clone https://github.com/benjamin-asdf/simple-easy-emacs.git
  cd simple-easy-emacs
  ./run.sh
#+end_src

** get started

First time takes a bit and are some (comp) warnings, this is fine.

After Emacs startup up, use `M-x` (that is alt + x) type ~simple ~.
Find ~simple-easy-clojure-hello~ and Ret to run the command.

After a bit a cider repl buffer should pop up.
If you lost where you are type ~C-x b~ to get a list of current buffers
Now checkout the file =hello.clj=.
Here are your spaceships controls:

~cider-eval-defun-at-point~ ~C-M-x~ (that is ctr + alt + x)
~cider-eval-last-sexp~ ~C-x C-e~
~cider-load-file~ ~C-c C-l~

Use ~C-M-i~ ~completion-in-region~  to completion candidates.

* Useful commands

1) The default Emacs editing and movement commands
    I searched Emacs cheat sheet and this popped up:
    https://www.shortcutfoo.com/app/dojos/emacs/cheatsheet

2) more commands (find them with M-x)

consult-buffer
window-left
window-right etc
describe-key
describe-variable
describe-function
describe-mode
describe-keymap

* Evil

see [[file:doc/evil.org]]

* Further packages to checkout:

You can find those on github, check their readme:

- marginalia (prettier completion candidates)
- magit
- evil + evil collection (you don't need doom to get vim binds)
- flycheck, flycheck-clj-kondo (get clj-kondo aswell)
- embark
- winner
- link-hint
- corfu or company for completion popups

** take config inspiration from mememacs:

https://github.com/benjamin-asdf/dotfiles/tree/master/mememacs/.emacs-mememacs.d

* Principles

** stick to defaults
- no evil
- builtin theme
- no projectile.el
- Yet, I do hesitate to configure builtins like show-paren-mode to give
  a more modern and minimal look and feel


** keep the amount of packages low
- preferably a newcomer could look at the config and not get lost

** novice friendly where feasible
- works on windows
- disable lock files
- no evil by default
- disable byte compile warnings (TODO)

** not a framework

I see users of config frameworks learning the way of the config framework.

*** Use-package + straight.el
- commonly used
- Readmes commonly have a use-package snippet
- I like how straight.el brings github repos as first class citizens
  sort of.

** use vertico + orderless + consult
Simple, focused and powerful.
These are virtually synonymous with "modern emacs config".

** simple mode line

I desire a modern and minimalist style, hence
